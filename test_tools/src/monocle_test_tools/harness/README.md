# Scenario Test Harness

The scenario harness tests an agent by **talking to it**. Instead of scripting every
turn, you describe a scenario — what you're testing, the user persona to play, the
details of the request — and an LLM-backed *test agent* holds the conversation with your
*target agent* while an LLM judge decides whether the scenario succeeded.

It answers questions a scripted test cannot:

- Does the agent *ask* for information it's missing, or invent it?
- Does it stay on task with an impatient, terse, or rude user?
- Does it actually complete the job, or just promise to?

This is the dynamic counterpart to `MultiTurnTestCase`. Use `MultiTurnTestCase` when you
know every turn in advance; use the harness when the point is that you *don't*.

---

## Installation

The harness needs LangChain, which is an optional extra:

```bash
pip install "monocle_test_tools[test_agent]"
```

Importing `monocle_test_tools` without it still works — the harness imports LangChain
lazily, so only the harness itself requires the extra.

---

## Quick start

```python
import pytest
from monocle_test_tools.harness import ScenarioHarness, ScenarioTestCase
from monocle_test_tools.runner.runner import AgentTypes

CASE = {
    "test_name": "book_flight_foul_mouthed_user",
    "scenario": "Book a flight from source to destination.",
    "persona": "A foul mouthed, impatient user who gives one detail at a time",
    "params": [
        {"name": "source",      "value": "San Francisco",     "is_initial": True,
         "description": "source airport"},
        {"name": "destination", "value": "Seattle",           "is_initial": False,
         "description": "destination airport"},
        {"name": "date",        "value": "22nd October 2026", "is_initial": False,
         "description": "travel date"},
    ],
    "success_criteria": "The agent confirms that the flight has been booked.",
    "max_turns": 8,
}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_books_a_flight(monocle_trace_asserter):
    harness = ScenarioHarness(ScenarioTestCase.model_validate(CASE))

    result = await harness.run_scenario_async(
        my_agent, AgentTypes.LANGGRAPH,
        target_description="A travel booking agent that books flights between airports "
                           "for a given date, and hotels in a city for a given date.")

    assert result.passed, result.report()
    monocle_trace_asserter.called_tool("book_flight")   # trace assertions still apply
```

The scenario spec is plain JSON, so keeping cases in a file needs no special loader:

```python
with open("scenario_test_cases.json", encoding="utf-8") as handle:
    cases = json.load(handle)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.parametrize("case", cases, ids=lambda c: c["test_name"])
async def test_scenario(case, monocle_trace_asserter):
    harness = ScenarioHarness(ScenarioTestCase.model_validate(case))
    ...
```

A complete worked example lives in
[`test_tools/tests/integration/test_scenario_harness.py`](../../../tests/integration/test_scenario_harness.py),
with its target agent in
[`test_tools/tests/test_common/langgraph_travel_agent.py`](../../../tests/test_common/langgraph_travel_agent.py).

---

## How a scenario runs

The **driver** owns the loop. Each turn it asks the test agent for the next user message,
sends that to your target agent through `MonocleValidator.run_agent_async`, and judges
the reply:

```
for turn in 1..max_turns:
    tester_msg    = test agent writes the next user message (in persona)
    target_reply  = run_agent_async(target, tester_msg, session_id=...)   # spans captured
    verdict       = judge(target_reply, success_criteria)
    if verdict.met: PASS
FAIL("max turns exhausted")
```

Three properties follow from that shape:

- **One session for the whole scenario.** A single `session_id` is threaded into every
  call, so your agent keeps its own memory across turns (LangGraph `thread_id`, ADK
  session, and so on), and each turn's spans are tagged with `scope.turn_id`.
- **The judge runs every turn and cannot be skipped.** Its verdict is the loop's exit
  condition and the test's result. The test agent also gets the same judge as an
  `evaluate_response` tool, but that copy is advisory — it only shapes what the tester
  says next.
- **The test agent emits no spans.** Its LLM calls, and the judge's, run under the
  `MONOCLE_SUPPRESS_SPANS` context flag, so `result.spans` holds target spans only and
  your trace assertions see nothing but the agent under test.

## The scenario spec

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_name` | `str` | `"monocle_scenario_test"` | Name of the scenario. |
| `scenario` | `str` | *required* | What is being tested. |
| `persona` | `str` | *required* | The user the test agent plays. |
| `params` | `list[ScenarioParam]` | `[]` | Details of the request (see below). |
| `success_criteria` | `str` | *required* | Free text, judged by an LLM. |
| `max_turns` | `int` | `10` | Maximum target-agent invocations. |
| `session_id` | `str` | auto | Shared by every turn; generated when omitted. |

Validation rejects an empty `scenario` or `success_criteria`, `max_turns < 1`, duplicate
param names, param names that aren't valid identifiers (they become tool names), and a
non-empty `params` list with no `is_initial` param — the test agent would have nothing to
open the conversation with.

### Parameters and progressive disclosure

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `str` | *required* | Becomes the tool name; must be an identifier. |
| `value` | `Any` | *required* | What the tool returns. |
| `description` | `str` | *required* | Becomes the tool description. |
| `is_initial` | `bool` | `False` | Stated in the opening message. |
| `required` | `bool` | `True` | The target must ask for it (see below). |

Every param becomes a **zero-argument tool** on the test agent. The preamble tells it to
call a tool *only* when the target agent asks for that detail:

```
turn 1  tester> I need a damn flight out of San Francisco.
        target> Where would you like to fly to?
turn 2  tester> [called destination()] Seattle, obviously.
        target> What date?
turn 3  tester> [called date()] 22nd October 2026. Get on with it.
```

The important part: **the value of a non-initial param never enters the prompt** — only
its name and description do. The test agent therefore *cannot* state the destination
without calling the tool first. Progressive disclosure is structural, not a matter of the
model following instructions.

Word `description` the way the *target agent* would refer to the detail, so the test
agent can match the target's question to the right tool.

### `required` — catching invented details

A `required` param whose tool was never called fails the scenario **even when the judge
says the criteria were met**. That combination is the signature of an agent satisfying
the success criteria with a detail it made up instead of asking for:

```
FAILED scenario 'Book a flight from source to destination.' after 4/8 turns
  reason: required params never requested: date
  never requested: date
  last verdict: The agent explicitly confirms that the flight has been booked.
  ...
```

The judge is telling the truth — a flight *was* booked. It was booked for a date nobody
ever supplied.

`is_initial` params are exempt: their values go out in the opening message, so there is
nothing left for the target to ask for. Set `required: false` for a detail the target is
free to skip.

> A "never requested" failure is worth reading carefully, because it can indict either
> side. A target agent that invents a value is a real bug in your agent. A *test agent*
> that invents one is a bug in the harness — check the preamble and what the driver puts
> in the tester's history before blaming the target.

## API

### `ScenarioHarness(case, model=None, judge_model=None, trace_test_agent=None)`

- **`case`** — a `ScenarioTestCase` or a plain `dict` (validated for you).
- **`model`** — the test agent's LLM: a model string or a built `BaseChatModel`.
  Defaults to `MONOCLE_TEST_AGENT_MODEL`, resolved with `init_chat_model`.
- **`judge_model`** — the judge's LLM. Defaults to `MONOCLE_TEST_JUDGE_MODEL`, falling
  back to the test agent's model.
- **`trace_test_agent`** — set `True` to stop suppressing the test agent's spans when
  you are debugging the tester itself. Defaults to `MONOCLE_TRACE_TEST_AGENT`.

Passing models explicitly is the route to take when a provider needs constructor
arguments `init_chat_model` can't supply from the environment — Azure OpenAI, for
instance:

```python
harness = ScenarioHarness(case,
                          model=AzureChatOpenAI(..., temperature=0.7),
                          judge_model=AzureChatOpenAI(..., temperature=0))
```

### `await harness.run_scenario_async(target_agent, agent_type, target_description)`

Runs the scenario and returns a `ScenarioResult`. It does **not** raise on a behavioral
failure — a target-agent exception is caught, recorded in `failure_reason`, and ends the
loop.

- **`target_agent`** — whatever the runner for `agent_type` expects (an agent object, a
  URL, …).
- **`agent_type`** — any value `get_agent_runner` accepts: `AgentTypes.LANGGRAPH`,
  `GOOGLE_ADK`, `CREWAI`, `STRANDS`, `LLAMAINDEX`, `OPENAI`, `MSAGENT`, `HTTP`, …
- **`target_description`** — what the target agent does, in a sentence or two. This goes
  into the test agent's system prompt, so it's how the tester knows what it can
  reasonably ask for.

### `await harness.test_scenario_async(...)`

Same arguments; runs the scenario, then asserts `result.passed` with `result.report()` as
the message. Use `run_scenario_async` when you want to inspect the result (including
negative tests, where a failure is the expected outcome).

### `ScenarioResult`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `passed` | Judge satisfied **and** no required param left unrequested. |
| `turns_used` / `max_turns` | Turns actually taken, and the budget. |
| `failure_reason` | `"max turns exhausted"`, `"target error: …"`, and/or the required-param clause. |
| `turns` | `TurnRecord` per turn: `tester_message`, `target_response`, `verdict`, `param_tools_called`. |
| `missing_required_params` | Required params the target never asked for. |
| `spans` | Target spans across the whole scenario. |
| `per_turn_spans` | Target spans, one tuple per turn. |
| `report()` | The whole run as a readable transcript — use it as your assert message. |

At the end of a run the harness points the validator's span pool at every target span the
scenario produced, so the `monocle_trace_asserter` fixture asserts across the whole
conversation rather than just the last turn.

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MONOCLE_TEST_AGENT_MODEL` | Test agent model, e.g. `openai:gpt-4.1`. Resolved by `init_chat_model`. |
| `MONOCLE_TEST_JUDGE_MODEL` | Judge model. Falls back to `MONOCLE_TEST_AGENT_MODEL`. |
| `MONOCLE_TRACE_TEST_AGENT` | `true` stops suppressing the test agent's spans, for debugging the tester. |

---

## Writing scenarios that test something

**Make the success criteria observable.** "Flight is booked" is judged against what the
agent *said*. The judge is instructed to be strict — a promise to book, or a follow-up
question, does not count as booked — so write criteria that a response can actually
demonstrate.

**Withhold what you want the agent to ask for.** A scenario where every param is
`is_initial` tests one long instruction, not a conversation. The interesting behavior
lives in what the agent does when something is missing.

**Let the persona do work.** A terse user who answers in three words, a user who changes
their mind, a user who is rude — these are the conditions under which agents drop context
or lose the thread. A polite, cooperative persona tests very little.

**Set `max_turns` to slightly more than the conversation should need.** It is a failure
budget, not a target. Raising it to make a failing scenario pass hides a loop that isn't
converging — read the transcript instead.

**Trace assertions and the judge answer different questions.** The judge reads what the
agent *said*; `monocle_trace_asserter` sees what it *did*. "Flight is booked" plus
`called_tool("book_flight")` is a much stronger test than either alone — an agent can
claim a booking without ever calling the tool.

---

## Debugging a failure

Start with `result.report()`. It prints every turn, which params the test agent had to
ask for, and the judge's reasoning per turn — usually enough to see whether the target
went off task, the criteria were unreachable, or the tester misbehaved.

If the tester itself looks wrong, set `MONOCLE_TRACE_TEST_AGENT=true` to stop suppressing
its spans, and its own inferences will show up in the traces alongside the target's.

Two failure shapes worth recognizing:

- **"max turns exhausted" with the target asking the same thing repeatedly** — the test
  agent isn't answering. Check that the param `description` matches the words the target
  uses to ask for it.
- **"required params never requested" while the judge says the criteria were met** — a
  detail was invented. Determine which side invented it: `param_tools_called` in the
  transcript tells you whether the tester ever fetched the real value.
